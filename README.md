# Pokémon Gen-1 Sprite Decompression
	
## About the project

The inspiration for this project came from a couple of videos from [Retro Game Mechanics Explained](https://www.youtube.com/@RGMechEx) on YouTube detailing how sprites were decompressed in the generation 1 Pokémon games (Red, Blue and Yellow). The process is quite technical, whilst also being simple, this is due to the constraints that the developers had with the Game Boy, with its limited ROM space, meaning technical solutions had to be developed to save space, whilst still being able to run on the limited processing power of the console.
